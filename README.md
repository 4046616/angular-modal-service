=====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dwmkerr/angular-modal-service.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dwmkerr/angular-modal-service)

Modal service for AngularJS - supports creating popups and modals via a service.

Developing
----------

To work with the code, just run:

```
npm install
bower install
```

and all code will be built and ready to go. To ensure the code is minified and updated to the `dst` folder
as you change it, just run:

```
grunt dev
```

The easiest way to adapt the code is to play with some of the examples in the ``samples`` folder.

Tests
-----

Run tests with:

```
npm test
```
